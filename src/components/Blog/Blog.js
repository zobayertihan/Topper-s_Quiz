                <p>The method of routing involves sending users to various websites in response to their requests or actions. The major use for ReactJS Router is the creation of single-page web applications. Multiple routes are defined in the application using React Router. A user will be sent to a certain route when they enter a particular URL into their browser and that URL path matches any of the "routes" in the router file.</p>

                <p> The React Router Package, a standard library system built on top of React, is used to provide routing in React applications. It gives the information that will be shown on the web page to the synchronous URL in the browser. It is mostly used for creating single-page web apps and preserves the application's regular structure and functionality.</p>
